# Modern TradeSkillMaster (WotLK 3.3.5)

A refreshed presentation of TradeSkillMaster 2.x for Wrath of the Lich King realms. This fork keeps the classic module set intact while delivering a modern layout, richer dashboards, and streamlined navigation inspired by contemporary TSM releases.

## Highlights

- **Modern Theme & Layout** – updated panels, typography, and navigation that mirror current TSM design language.
- **Retail-Style Components** – reusable containers, collapsible sections, new graph widgets, and refined widgets across every module.
- **Dashboards & Analytics** – gold tracking, sales/expense overlays, and accounting insights available inside the core addon.
- **Full Module Suite** – Accounting, AuctionDB, Auctioning, Crafting, Destroying, ItemTracker, Mailing, Shopping, and Warehousing are bundled and kept in sync.
- **Phase Documentation & Tests** – source includes the full modernization notes, implementation guides, and Lua test harnesses used during the port.
- **Drop-In Compatible** – runs on any 3.3.5a environment (Ascension, Warmane, etc.) without breaking existing TSM data or profiles.
