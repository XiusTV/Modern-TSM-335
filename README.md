# Modern TradeSkillMaster (WotLK 3.3.5)

A refreshed presentation of TradeSkillMaster 2.x for Wrath of the Lich King realms. This fork keeps the classic module set intact while delivering a modern layout, richer dashboards, and streamlined navigation inspired by contemporary TSM releases.

## Highlights

- **Modern Theme & Layout** – updated panels, typography, and navigation that mirror current TSM design language.
- **Retail-Style Components** – reusable containers, collapsible sections, new graph widgets, and refined widgets across every module.
- **Dashboards & Analytics** – gold tracking, sales/expense overlays, and accounting insights available inside the core addon.
- **Full Module Suite** – Accounting, AuctionDB, Auctioning, Crafting, Destroying, ItemTracker, Mailing, Shopping, and Warehousing are bundled and kept in sync.
- **Phase Documentation & Tests** – source includes the full modernization notes, implementation guides, and Lua test harnesses used during the port.
- **Drop-In Compatible** – runs on any 3.3.5a environment (Ascension, Warmane, etc.) without breaking. **Special Note Profiles are saved differently on Ascension then other private servers. Expect a new profile if your coming from ascension to other servers or vice versa. Your profiles should save correctly on any ascension project, or any 3.3.5 private server they just wont copy over**
